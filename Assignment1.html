<ul style="list-style-type:none">
	<li>My knowledge in all things computer science is relatively new. My first entry point into web development came with learning basic HTML to beautify my myspace profile.
Since then, I've worked in an office that allows me to oversee our 3rd party web platforms. However, I've only become proficient in the platforms through a user perspective, never through the lens of a developer.</li>

<b><font color="pink">Software Development Background:</b></font>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
	<li>I haven't yet had experience with software development. Once again, I've worked on projects to enable Single-Sign-On and to connect 1 platform to another via API's. However, I was the liaison between our developers and the site's developers. I've gotten somewhat comfortable with the terminology used, but not skilled yet to figure out how to conduct these on my own.</li>
